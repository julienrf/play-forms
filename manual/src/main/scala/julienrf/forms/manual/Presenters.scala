## Presenters

The last piece of the puzzle are [`Presenter`](http://julienrf.github.io/play-forms/0.0.0-SNAPSHOT/api/#julienrf.forms.presenters.Presenter)s.

As its name suggests, a `Presenter[A]` defines how to present a field of type `A` to the client.

play-forms provides some ready to use `Presenter`s (e.g. `Input` and `Select`). They can be useful to quickly bootstrap
a user interface but it is highly probable that you will write a `Presenter` specific to the design of the UI of your
project.

Thankfully, the code of existing `Presenter` is modular and reusable so you wonâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel each time.
Also, note that the type parameter `A` gives the opportunity to perform type-level computations to derive some parts of
the UI.
